## About HOWTOs

I followed my fair share of HOWTOs over the years and had to learn that they should be taken with a grain of salt. They usually don't age well and often leave out important steps because the author did not consider them important or the system it was tested on already had certain things in place that the system of the reader might not have.

Now I am starting to blog and the first thing I wanted to write about is how to get up and running if you want to contribute to [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) development - so just another HOWTO. I started to do that. But something felt wrong. It was particular to my OS ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)) and I was pretty sure that some things could be misunderstood. So I braced myself to start pouring over it and add more information for other OSSes, other versions, etc. - *phew* that's hard work and will be obsolete not to far in the future, I thought to myself. There had to be a better way.
