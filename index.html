        <p>Welcome to my little corner in the interwebs. I am a software developer at <a href="https://avira.com">Avira</a> and a coach at the <a href="https://python-academy.com/">Python Academy</a>. I write mainly about programming ... if I ever write. I mean, I write a lot. But usually it ends up half done and abandoned in the less fashionable and harder to reach corners of my hard disk. On the other hand: I have written two complete articles in the last two days! There might be hope that I will write even more in the future. Let's see what happens.</p>

<p>When I was hyping myself up to write the second article on my website after almost 3 years I naturally had a look how I can busy myself with everything else but writing the actual article (while still fooling myself into believing this is a necessary preparation for &#8230; <strong>just writing the blimmin&#8217; article</strong>. But I think the work in my website generation laboratory was worth the fuzz this time, as I quite enjoy the new workflow. I now can write code sprinkled articles in a Jupyter notebook and have them rendered automatically into my lektor generated website using a bit of Python code hooked into lektors plugin&nbsp;system.</p>

<p>Carl Sagan wrote in Cosmos that we are all made of &#8220;star-stuff&#8221;. The elements that make life on earth possible were formed in stars a long time ago. It puts things into perspective to remember that we still have no clue <strong>how</strong> the first life on earth came to be and <strong>why</strong> we run around on this rock hurtling through space, but at least we know that we are all made from stars :). You ask yourself what this has to do with Python? Right. Nothing. But obvioulsy the humans involved in the development of Python are also made of star-stuff and I like to believe that their deep sense of wonder about the miracle of life has inspired them to put so darn many stars into its&nbsp;syntax.</p>

<p>The history of the underscore goes back to mechanical typewriters as a way to combine them with text in order to &#8230; <strong>surprise</strong> &#8230; underscore text. I don&#8217;t know whether it was due to inertia, backwards compatibility considerations, or the missing insight that underscoring text might work differently on computers, but whatever it was: the underscore made it into the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"><span class="caps">US</span>-<span class="caps">ASCII</span></a> character encoding standard in the 1960s and is here to stay. In Python it has also found many creative uses providing contextual information about a&nbsp;name.</p>
