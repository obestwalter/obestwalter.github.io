[![participants of the pytest sprint 2016](pytest-sprint-2016.jpg)](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/)

In the summer of 2016 I took part in the first dedicated pytest development sprint together with about 25 humans from all over the planet. We had a great time together with engaging discussions, technical talks, and lots of hacking.

As a happy [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) customer I volunteered to help in preparing the next release by reviewing pull requests and going through the issues. I also did some [conceptual work](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/5b0f92b91f272abcf403d42b82ba58c169f7eeb8/doc/drafts/extend-envs-and-packagebuilds.md) with [nicoddemus](https://github.com/nicoddemus) and [Stephan Obermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-obermann-49346a125/).

In my work on pytest I had the honour of [dropping the dot](https://twitter.com/davehunt82/status/756080181085872129) together with [Dave Hunt](http://davehunt.co.uk/) for the 3.0 release. I also proposed and implemented a [deprecation policy](https://rawgit.com/obestwalter/pytest-exit-strategy/master/#slide1).

After the sprint I did not have much spare time to get more involved, which bugged me, so I started to sound out the option of integrating this into my work at [Avira](https://avira.com). As pytest/tox/devpi is something we heavily rely on, I was able to secure the support of my team and management to spend 20% of my time on tox development starting in 2017.

To get started I ...

* joined the conversations on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues) about problems and enhancements to develop an understanding about what is needed and how things can be improved
* labelled all open issues (and am determined to [keep it that way](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel))
* identified invalid/fixed/duplicate issues (a third of ~180 issues were closed as a result)

These and similar activities around open source projects where coined as [open source gardening](http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener) by Steve Klabnik. I think they are just as important as contributing code to keep a project healthy and I will concentrate on this field of work for the time being.

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful that Avira is aware of the importance of open source and gives me the chance to contribute regularly as part of my work. I'd like to thank [Martin Held](https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-held-b287823), [Andreas Flach](https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreas-flach-33446a6) and [Gitte Klitgaard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitteklitgaard) for their support in getting this on the road.
