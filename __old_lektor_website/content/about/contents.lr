*(My first band! I'm the guy on the left at the front.)*

* Born in Germany on Star Wars day in the year the last man landed on the moon
* Loves all kinds of good and bad films and books and games and is a bit of an indoor enthusiast
* Definitely more on the introverted side of the spectrum (but really likes humans as a concept)
* 1970s - 2000: sang, played guitar, keyboards and bass in varying bands and music projects, starting when seven years old in the children's rock choir [Rauch und Feuerschwalben](http://www.stephan-schelle.de/grobschnitt/images/presse/wp_6_11_82.htm)
* Since the mid 1980s: Computering with all kinds of machines starting with a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)
* 2000 - 2007: [machine operator and quality assurance in a semi conductor factory](https://www.micronas.com/)
* Since 2006: Python is a honking great idea -- let's do more of that! 
* 2007-2011: although "not good at math" and "already too old" - studied [Computer Engineering](https://www.hs-emden-leer.de/)
* Since 2011: Software Developer at [Avira](https://avira.com)
* Since 2013: [occasional public speaker](/speaking/)
* 2017 - 2019: [occasional open source gardener](/articles/becoming-an-open-source-gardener) (maybe I can pick that up again in the future)
* Since 2017: [occasional Python coach](/teaching/)
