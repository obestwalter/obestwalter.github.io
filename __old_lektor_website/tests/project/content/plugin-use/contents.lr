Here the lektor-markdown-highlighter is being used for a very serious Python snippet.

```python
from sys import exit

def say_hi():
    print("Hello World!") # Engage in conversation

def ignore_everything():
    exit(0) # Successful exit

if being_looked_at is True:
    say_hi()
else:
    ignore_everything()
```
