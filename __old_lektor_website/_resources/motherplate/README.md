# Motherplate: A Responsive SCSS Boilerplate for Web Designers

Preview: http://leemunroe.github.io/motherplate/example.html

## What is this?
This is a bare bones HTML/CSS framework. This is what I'll typically start off most web projects with.

It includes a CSS reset and a bunch of minimal boilerplate styles that should come in useful for any project, including a responsive grid, typography, buttons, icons and forms.

It is not as in depth as something like <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and doesn't include styled components like <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>.

It can be used for a static web project as is, or you can copy the CSS folder into an existing framework (e.g. Rails).

## Features
* Uses SCSS partials to help structure the CSS.
* Responsive-ready 12-column grid system to work across all devices.
* Uses Font Awesome icon fonts for icons.
* Uses Normalize to reset browser styles.
* Only enough CSS to get you started; minimal visual styling with this boilerplate.
* Only the HTML/JS you need to get started; very little components with this boilerplate.

## How to Use
This will vary depending on the framework you are using. The following is how to for a basic static website.

### Install Node.js and use Grunt
Motherplate uses SCSS. This particular repo uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile the SCSS to CSS and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage external dependencies like FontAwesome and Normalize.

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/). 

Open up terminal (or command line) and run the default Grunt task.
```
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

Grunt will watch for any changes you make to your SCSS files and compile your new `main.css` file.

## HTML
A bare bones index.html template.

## CSS
* `base/config` Put all your variables in here e.g. colors, padding, border radius - this helps with consistency across your project.
* `base/grid` A basic responsive grid system with 12 columns.
* `base/ie` Any styles that you need to add in order for Internet Explorer to work.
* `base/mixins` Reusabled Sass mixins e.g. clearfix.
* `base/print` Basic print stylesheets to make your pages look better when printed.
* `base/responsive` Add any global responsive styles here e.g. hide elements, show elements, resize elements.
* `base/shame` Keep this to hand for any quick and dirty CSS you need to add but plan to tidy later.
* `base/type` Basic styling for your typography.
* `components/alerts` Alerts to notify or give feedback to the user
* `components/buttons` Styles for any text links and/or buttons.
* `components/forms` Some basic form styles.
* `components/media` Styles for images, video etc.
* `components/nav` Inline navigation.
* `components/other` Other reusable styles that come in handy.
* `components/tables` Styles for tables.
* `pages/home` Styles that are specific to the homepage
* `pages/layout` Global layout styles e.g. header, footer, logo etc.
* `main.scss` This brings all the partials together. Compass only compiles files that don't have an underscore

As your project grows and you need to add more styles just create new .scss files and reference them anywhere in your main.scss file.

## JavaScript ##
* I've included some basic Javascript including the latest jQuery and the document ready function.

## Images ##
* There is a /img folder for images.
* For images referenced in the CSS I tend to keep them in the css/assets/ folder e.g. sp.png is a sprite I can reference.
* Images referenced in the HTML are stored in the /img folder.

## Fonts ##
* Included font awesome for icons
