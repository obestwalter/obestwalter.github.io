## FAQ

Q: Why did you create a personal homepage in 2016? That's so 90s of you! Is that even allowed?

A: Since I learned a bit of HTML in the 90s to make a home page for a friend, I always thought that I could also make one for myself soon. Booom! Only a few decades later I finally did it. Technology has advanced though and made everything much easier. So today -- instead of using HTML -- I use Python, Markdown, YAML and CSS ... and HTML ... with Jinja2 templating. Much simpler than in the 90s. Yay, progress!

Q: So you know all this fancy stuff. Good for you. But why doesn't it look fancy then? Did you channel your past self from the last century that just learned a bit of HTML to "design" this?

A: I happen to like the last century. Get off my lawn.

Q: Ok, I'll go. Just one more question. Will there be any ... content?

A: Do you really need more content? Isn't there enough already? Who is supposed to read all this? I think the world has more than enough content, so I rather keep it nice and empty here. I recently started leaving a bit of content on other peoples home pages though ...
