## NEXT then the different meanings of `_` 

## Something I really must underscore ...

### `_` (single underscore)

Doesn't look like much, but has quite a few special meanings

As the (complete) name: "I have to assign a name here, but won't be using it"


```python
left, _, right = (0, 1, 2)
left, right

```
```text
[result]
(0, 2)
```

```python
for _ in range(3):
    print("hi")

```
```text
[stdout]
hi
hi
hi

```
As prefix: "This is private, please don't use it"


```python
_private_name = "Please don't access me from outside"

```
As postfix: "I would shadow something here , but really wan't to name it that way."


```python
dir_ = "somedir"  #  Don't overwrite builtin dir
dir(dir_)[0]

```
```text
[result]
'__add__'
```
## `__` (double underscore (a.k.a. dunder))

* as prefix in a class method: "mangle the name, I might want to still use that, even if it's overwritten"


```python
class A:
    def __mangled(self):
        print("a")


A.__mangled

```
```text
[AttributeError]
type object 'A' has no attribute '__mangled'
```

```python
a = A()
a.__mangled

```
```text
[AttributeError]
'A' object has no attribute '__mangled'
```

```python
A._A__mangled

```
```text
[result]
<function __main__.A.__mangled(self)>
```

```python
class B(A):
    def __mangled(self):
        print("b")

```

```python
B._A__mangled

```
```text
[result]
<function __main__.A.__mangled(self)>
```
## `__...__` (double double underscore)

### (a.k.a. also dunder ... I think)

### ["I am very special, maybe even magic ..."](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)

> A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names. This is Pythonâ€™s approach to operator overloading, allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators. 

-- [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)

... They are defining "language operators" very broadly there

# Passing arguments

Independent order if using kwargs even for positional arguments


```python
def func(foo, *args, baz=None, **kwargs):
    print(f"foo: {foo}, args: {args}, baz: {baz}, kwargs: {kwargs}")


func(1, 2, 3, 4)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 1, args: (2, 3, 4), baz: None, kwargs: {}

```

```python
func(2, 1, 3, x=5)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 2, args: (1, 3), baz: None, kwargs: {'x': 5}

```

```python
func(bar=2, foo=1)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 1, args: (), baz: None, kwargs: {'bar': 2}

```

```python
func(2, 4, bar=2)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 2, args: (4,), baz: None, kwargs: {'bar': 2}

```

```python
func(bar=2, foo=1, baz=3)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 1, args: (), baz: 3, kwargs: {'bar': 2}

```

```python
func(bar=2, foo=1, baz=3, bam=4)

```
```text
[stdout]
foo: 1, args: (), baz: 3, kwargs: {'bar': 2, 'bam': 4}

```
## Arguments are passed by assignment

That is **neither** pass by value nor pass by reference

... but closer to call by reference - except that you can't pass a reference to a reference.

In C++ you would call this [pass by const reference](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3445.html), which means you can't pass a pointer to a pointer (please correct me if I am wrong - C++ is not my string suite).

## Boolean operations return the object

(**not** a boolean)


```python
emtpy_list = []
non_empty_list = [1, 2, "That's handy actually ..."]
emtpy_list or non_empty_list

```
```text
[result]
[1, 2, "That's handy actually ..."]
```
## Handy in assignments of function arguments


```python
def foo(my_list=None):
    my_list = my_list or []

```
(To avoid the mutable objects as default parameters gotcha)


```python
def foo(my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(1)
    print(my_list)


foo(), foo(), foo(), foo()

```
```text
[stdout]
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]

```
```text
[result]
(None, None, None, None)
```
