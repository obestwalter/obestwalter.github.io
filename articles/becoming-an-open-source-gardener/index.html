            <p><a href="http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/"><img src="/articles/becoming-an-open-source-gardener/pytest-sprint-2016.jpg" alt="participants of the pytest sprint 2016"></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 2016 I took part in the first dedicated pytest development sprint together with about 25 humans from all over the planet. We had a great time together with engaging discussions, technical talks, and lots of&nbsp;hacking.</p>

        </div>
    
    <p>As a happy <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io">tox</a> customer I volunteered to help in preparing the next release by reviewing pull requests and going through the issues. I also did some <a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/5b0f92b91f272abcf403d42b82ba58c169f7eeb8/doc/drafts/extend-envs-and-packagebuilds.md">conceptual work</a> with <a href="https://github.com/nicoddemus">nicoddemus</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-obermann-49346a125/">Stephan Obermann</a>.</p>
<p>In my work on pytest I had the honour of <a href="https://twitter.com/davehunt82/status/756080181085872129">dropping the dot</a> together with <a href="http://davehunt.co.uk/">Dave Hunt</a> for the 3.0 release. I also proposed and implemented a <a href="https://rawgit.com/obestwalter/pytest-exit-strategy/master/#slide1">deprecation policy</a>.</p>
<p>After the sprint I did not have much spare time to get more involved, which bugged me, so I started to sound out the option of integrating this into my work at <a href="https://avira.com">Avira</a>. As pytest/tox/devpi is something we heavily rely on, I was able to secure the support of my team and management to spend 20% of my time on tox development starting in&nbsp;2017.</p>
<p>To get started I&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>joined the conversations on the <a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues">issue tracker</a> about problems and enhancements to develop an understanding about what is needed and how things can be&nbsp;improved</li>
<li>labelled all open issues (and am determined to <a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel">keep it that way</a>)</li>
<li>identified invalid/fixed/duplicate issues (a third of ~180 issues were closed as a&nbsp;result)</li>
</ul>
<p>These and similar activities around open source projects where coined as <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener">open source gardening</a> by Steve Klabnik. I think they are just as important as contributing code to keep a project healthy and I will concentrate on this field of work for the time&nbsp;being.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements <a class="header-anchor" href="#acknowledgements">&#128279;</a></h2><p>I am grateful that Avira is aware of the importance of open source and gives me the chance to contribute regularly as part of my work. I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-held-b287823">Martin Held</a>, <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreas-flach-33446a6">Andreas Flach</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitteklitgaard">Gitte Klitgaard</a> for their support in getting this on the&nbsp;road.</p>
