I don't know whether it was due to inertia, backwards compatibility considerations, or the missing insight that underscoring text might work differently on computers, but whatever it was: the underscore made it into the original [US-ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character encoding standard in the 1960s and is here to stay. In Python it has also found many creative uses providing contextual information about a name.\n",

So, for the sake of readability the system needs to be tricked into believing that several words are one while still providing some kind of visual separation for the human reader. Born were constructs like `CheeseGrater` or `cheese_grater` - a.k.a. [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). \n",
