# Installation

Atm it's still safer to use the weirdo 2.7 installation instead of installing it with pip in Python3 (had weird problems and as I am new to lektor I go for the recommended way until I know my way around).

    mkvirtualenv 2.7.11 lektor
    curl -sf https://www.getlektor.com/install.sh | sh
    pip install -e .
