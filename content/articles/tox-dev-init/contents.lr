### Intro

I work as a a Software Developer in a small team at [Avira](https://avira.com) since 2011. Our team has built highly available distributed systems to automate all builds and releases based on Open Source Software ([Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/linux.html) to name the most prominent).

6 years ago we were the only team at Avira working with Python (AFAIK - correct me if I am wrong :)) - today we are many. Python - being the second best language for everything - helps solving a lot of different problems at Avira: process, test and release automation; web applications; prototyping automation of system deployments and administration (as part of a DevOps approach to things); data science; machine learning ... and I am sure I still forgot a lot.

Our team is completely responsible for the whole life cycle of our projects. This means we design, develop and maintain our systems. We also choose and administrate the systems our projects run on whether it is on site or in the cloud. Being in charge of the whole stack as a very small team is empowering but can be quite overwhelming. Also the way Avira works and the way we organize our processes has changed drastically over the last years. Some of our systems need to be available 24/7 and so we had to make sure that we can update our systems often and quickly without compromising their stability. This lead us to becoming automation enthusiasts and we learned a lot about continuous integration, test automation and automated provisioning. Without good tooling you are lost and most of that tooling, we found in the Open Source Ecosystem. Having all this in place also paid of, when we switched our complete code base from Python 2.7 to Python 3.4 last year. It was a lot of work, but we had no bad surprises or unplanned downtimes and the migration also resulted in our code base and tool chain being in a much better shape.

We rely heavily on pytest/tox/devpi for testing and deployment and so it felt quite natural to get more involved in that community, which I did when I joined the first [python testing sprint](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/) in the summer of 2016.

Quite a few of those teams rely on the testing tools developed by [Holger Krekel](https://holgerkrekel.net/) and a growing global community. Last summer I was lucky enough to attend the first [dedicated python testing sprint](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/) which was a great experience. I started to get involved with [tox issues](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/pulls) and with envisioning the general direction the tool could take [(#338)](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/338).

After the sprint I tried to keep in touch with the development, which led to Holger offering me to join in as a maintainer. I realized that this kind of work is is something I really want to get more into and that it would also be in the interest of my company. The folks at Avira understand that being properly involved in Open Source has a lot of benefits and that it is important for the overall health of the rapidly evolving world of Software that everybody pulls their weight (for more on that, see [Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labour Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure)).

So I started talking to some people and since the beginning of 2017 I can use 20% of my time at for Open Source work (yay! Thanks Avira!). I am very grateful to have the opportunity to have the time to focus more on Open Source development and to be a member of a truly global community.

### Log

#### 2016

It all started with the [python testing sprint](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/). I mainly worked on tox, but what I am most proud of is that I had the honour to [drop the dot](https://twitter.com/davehunt82/status/756080181085872129) together with [Dave Hunt](http://davehunt.co.uk/).

Over autumn and winter I did not have much spare time to get my fet wet and more involved but what I did was:

* Getting involved in the conversation about problems and enhancements to develop an understanding about what is needed and how things can be improved
* Scanning the issue tracker for invalid/fixed/duplicate issues

#### 2017

##### January

* Set up this blog to document my work
* Learn about the tox development and release work flow
* Make sure I can run tests in the most comprehensible way possible on Linux, Mac and Windows (experimenting with Vagrant for that, which might result in vagrant boxes for tox/pytest/devpi development)
* Thinking about how to actually organize the work, what to expect and what mid and long term aims I want to set myself
