### 2016

I had the best possible start at the [python testing sprint](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/) in the summer. A very productive week with engaging discussions, technical talks and lots of hacking. I mainly worked on tox. We prepared the move to Github by merging most of the open Pull Requests and did some [conceptual work](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/doc/drafts/extend-envs-and-packagebuilds.md) with [nicoddemus](https://nicoddemus.github.io/) and [Stephan Obermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-obermann-49346a125/). I also had the honour to [drop the dot from py.test](https://twitter.com/davehunt82/status/756080181085872129) together with [Dave Hunt](http://davehunt.co.uk/).

After the sprint I did not have much spare time to get more involved, which bugged me and I started to feel out if I could integrate this as a regular activity on company time. As pytest/tox/devpi is something we heavily rely on at Avira I was able to secure the support of my team and the management to spend 20% of my time for tox development starting 2017. I am grateful that the people at Avira are aware of the importance of Open Source and give me the chance to contribute regularly as part of my work. I'd like to thank [Rainer Hau√ümann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainerhaussmann), [Martin Held](https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-held-b287823),[Andreas Flach](https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreas-flach-33446a6) and [Gitte Klitgaard](https://twitter.com/NativeWired) for for their support to get this on the road.

What I did to get started was:

* Joined the conversations on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues) about problems and enhancements to develop an understanding about what is needed and how things can be improved
* Labelled all open issues
* Identified invalid/fixed/duplicate issues (~60 out of ~180 issues could be closed just because of that)

I think these activities that have not directly to do with contributing code are important to keep a project healthy and I plan to keep make this my main work on the project.

### 2017

#### January

* Learn about the tox development and release work flow
* Make sure I can run tests in the most comprehensible way possible on Linux, Mac and Windows (experimenting with Vagrant for that, which might result in vagrant boxes for tox/pytest/devpi development)
* Thinking about how to actually organize the work, what to expect and what mid and long term aims I want to set myself

#### February

* Started to review and merge Pull Requests
* Prepared and released versions 2.6.0
* Set up this blog to document my work
