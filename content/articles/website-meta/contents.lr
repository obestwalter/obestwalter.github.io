![a normal day in the office (keeping the lab equipment from exploding)](normal-day-at-the-office.gif)

When I was hyping myself up to write the second article on my website after almost 3 years I naturally had a look how I can busy myself with everything else but writing the actual article (while still fooling myself into believing this is a necessary preparation for ... **just writing an article**. But I think the work in my website generation lab was worth the fuzz this time, as I quite enjoy the new workflow. I enjoy it so much, that I am actually publishing articles now. I can write code sprinkled articles in a Jupyter notebook and have them rendered automatically into my lektor generated website using a bit of Python code hooked into lektors plugin system.

It is a never ending story: every time I want to write an article to publish on my website, I change my blog engine instead. At some point I even created my own [static website generator](https://github.com/obestwalter/loslassa). All this fuzz just to avoid actually writing things to ... you know ... put on a website :). This might be excused by the fact that I really enjoy spending my leisure time tinkering with things aimlessly rather then actually producing something that might be useful, but I finally started seeing through my evil self sabotage mechanisms and was determined to put a stop to it! So I did the natural thing: I went to my website generation lab[^1] and tinkered with the engine.

## Ingredients

### 1) A static website generator generator (sic!)

I played with a lot of blog engines over the years - while never blogging anything. I mostly work in backend development, but there is something that fascinates me about web design and web development. It's one of these things I guess :). I am particularly fond of static website generators that provide a workflow that is similar to developing software. I played with [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [nikola](https://getnikola.com/) and the lot. As already mentioned: I even wrote my own [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) based generator ... while still never really blogging anything. 

At the beginning of 2017 I made a deal with a colleague that I would write a blog article about the pytest development sprint I went to and tell a bit about my involvement. It would have been boring though if I would have used the site I had already online (last incarnation was a simple [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) driven thing). It would also have been boring to at least use one of the engines I already knew. Using something utterly profane like medium or a hosted wordpress instance was obviously completely out of the question! I mean, I could have just written the article then and be done with it. Who wants that? Right. Not me. So I started looking around for the next thing that could keep me from writing that article and I stumbled over [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/). Now this was something that could keep me busy for a while as it is not simply a static website generator, but rather something that you can use to generate a static website generator with. Long story short: I set that up from scratch with a [simple style](https://github.com/obestwalter/obestwalter.github.io/blob/lektor-sources/_style/style.sass), wrote a [little plugin](https://github.com/obestwalter/obestwalter.github.io/blob/lektor-sources/packages/lektor-sass/lektor_sass.py) to integrate that into lektors development server, and finally actually wrote and [published that article](/articles/becoming-an-open-source-gardener/). Nobody ever made a deal with me again that forced me to write another article, so that was it. I had unlocked the *"i-have-a-blog-but-i-never-blog-achievement"* once again. Until very recently.

Because recently I realized that I have produced a lot of materials while trying to teach Python and testing to all kinds of folks over the last years. That is a lot of fun and also very educational for myself. I finally wanted to start sharing some of these materials on my blog. As making strange deals seems to work with my contorted psyche, I made a deal with myself to publish at least one article a month for at least a year.

## Creating a lektor plugin to generate articles from a Jupyter notebook

!!!! I was really determined this time to just make this work, so that I can do some actual writing. So this might be all horribly wrong, but it works well enough. As I am the only user I don't mind if things are a bit quirky as long as I understand what's going on.

* website generation and git based deployment: [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com)
* free hosting under my own domain with ssl: [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* writing "normal" articles: [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* writing code heavy articles in an interactive authoring environment: [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (with a build step to convert this into input for lektor)
