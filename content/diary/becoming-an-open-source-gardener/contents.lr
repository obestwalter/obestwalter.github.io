In the summer of 2016 I took part in the first dedicated [python testing sprint](http://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/) together with more than 20 people from all over the planet. We had a great time together with engaging discussions, technical talks, and lots of hacking. I was interested to get into tox and helped to prepare the move to Github by merging Pull Requests as they are a pain to move. I also did some [planning](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/doc/drafts/extend-envs-and-packagebuilds.md) with [nicoddemus](https://github.com/nicoddemus) and [Stephan Obermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-obermann-49346a125/). I also had the honour to [drop the dot from py.test](https://twitter.com/davehunt82/status/756080181085872129) together with [Dave Hunt](http://davehunt.co.uk/).

After the sprint I did not have much spare time to get more involved, which bugged me so I started to feel out if I could integrate this as a regular activity as part of my work at Avira. As pytest/tox/devpi is something we heavily rely on I was able to secure the support of my team and the management to spend 20% of my time for tox development starting 2017. I am grateful that the people at Avira are aware of the importance of Open Source and give me the chance to contribute regularly as part of my work. I'd like to thank [Rainer Hau√ümann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainerhaussmann), [Martin Held](https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-held-b287823),[Andreas Flach](https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreas-flach-33446a6) and [Gitte Klitgaard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitteklitgaard) for for their support to get this on the road.

To get started I ...

* joined the conversations on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues) about problems and enhancements to develop an understanding about what is needed and how things can be improved
* labelled all open issues
* identified invalid/fixed/duplicate issues (~60 out of ~180 issues were closed as a result)

I think these activities that have not directly to do with contributing code are just as important to keep a project healthy and I will concentrate on this kind of work for the time being.

BTW: AFAICT Steve Klabnik coined the term [Open Source Gardener](http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener).
