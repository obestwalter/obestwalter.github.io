## ... I help maintaining

* [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) - a command line driven CI frontend and development task automation tool

## ... I contribute(d) to

* [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org) - my favorite testing framework
* [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/) - a minimalist production ready plugin system (powering pytest and tox)
* [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) - the installer for the great [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) tool
* [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) - software to automate the management and configuration of any infrastructure or application at scale
* ... and wherever else I see a way to make myself useful

## ... I created to help me teach Python

* [Mau Mau](http://oliver.bestwalter.de/mau-mau) - a complete project that can be used to learn about Python and it's ecosystem using a simple card game simulation as the teaching vehicle
* [Codecats CV](http://oliver.bestwalter.de/codecats-cv) - another project used for teaching "full stack" Python (with [Falk Heger](https://github.com/Falk92)).
* [commodorificator](https://gitlab.com/obestwalter/commodorificator) - another little teaching vehicle to showcase the Gitlab workflow and to introduce hypothesis

## ... I created ... because why not?

* [i3configger](https://github.com/obestwalter/i3configger) - a tool to make the configuration of the [i3wm tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) more malleable
* [devpi-cloud-test](https://github.com/obestwalter/devpi-cloud-test) - to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to test packages from [devpi](http://doc.devpi.net/)

## Other stuff I did
