# Projects

## ... I contribute to

* [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) - testing out of the box in Python.
* [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org) - my favorite testing framework.
* [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) - the installer for the great [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) tool.
* ... and wherever else I see a way to make myself useful.

## ... I created to help me teach Python

* [Mau Mau](http://oliver.bestwalter.de/mau-mau) - a card game simulation. Complete project that can be used to learn about Python and it's ecosystem.
* [Codecats CV](http://oliver.bestwalter.de/codecats-cv) - another project used for teaching "full stack" Python (with [Falk Heger](https://github.com/Falk92)).
* [Python Exploration Toolkit](http://oliver.bestwalter.de/pet) - a chaotic collection of writings and learning tools waiting to be organized.

## ... I created ... because why not?

* [i3configger](https://github.com/obestwalter/i3configger) - a tool to make the configuration of the [i3wm tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) more malleable.
* [devpi-cloud-test](https://github.com/obestwalter/devpi-cloud-test) - to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to test packages from [devpi](http://doc.devpi.net/).
