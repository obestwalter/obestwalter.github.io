# Helping others (and myself) to learn

*(Teaching Python to the CodeCats at Zeppelin University)*

Since 2017, I occasionally visit other organisations to give workshops. I focus on teaching the fundamentals of Python (not to be confused with "basics") and testing / test automation with [pytest](https://pytest.org), [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) and other FOSS projects (e.g. [professional testing with pytest](https://www.python-academy.com/courses/specialtopics/python_course_testing.html)). I enjoy teaching and always feel that I learn just as much as my students during these intense trainings.

I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to visit interesting organisations like [Advantest](https://www.advantest.com/), the European Institute For Energy Research ([EIFER](https://www.eifer.kit.edu/)), [Bosch](https://www.bosch.de/), [BMW Car IT](https://www.bmw-carit.de/), and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/europe). 

My main occupation is with [Avira](https://avira.com), so I am not a full time trainer. This has advantages and disadvantages. I like to think that what I lack in routine and teaching experience I make up with my enthusiasm and real world experience working as a Python developer. I usually adjust the course to the needs of the group and have a growing body of materials to base on.

If you would like to inquire about a customized training, do not hesitate even for a picosecond and [get in touch](/about/#get-in-touch).
