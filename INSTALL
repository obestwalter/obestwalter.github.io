Atm it's still safer to use the weirdo 2.7 installation instead of installing it with pip in Python3 (had weird problems and as I am new to lektor I go for the recommended way until I know my way around).

    mkvirtualenv 2.7.11 lektor
    curl -sf https://www.getlektor.com/install.sh | sh
    pip install -e .

The inbuilt pygments plugin has a bug (creates wrong classname 'highlight' instead of 'hll'). I use my own stylesheet with adapted classname atm. Hint: list themes with `pygmentize -L` and generate css files with `pygmentize -S <theme name> -f html > <file name>.css`
